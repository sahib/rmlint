``rmlint`` finds space waste and other broken things on your filesystem and offers
to remove it. It is able to find:

.. hlist::
   :columns: 2

   + Duplicate files & directories.
   + Nonstripped Binaries 
   + Broken symlinks.
   + Empty files.
   + Recursive empty directories.
   + Files with broken user or group id.

**Key Features:**

.. hlist::
   :columns: 3

   + Extremely fast.
   + Flexible and easy commandline options.
   + Choice of several hashes for hash-based deplicate detection
   + Option for exact byte-by-byte comparison (only slightly slower).
   + Numerous output options.
   + Option to store time of last run; next time will only scan new files.
   + Many options for original selection / prioritisation.
   + Can handle very large file sets (millions of files).
   + Colorful progressbar. (😃)
