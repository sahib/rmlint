``rmlint`` finds space waste and other broken things on your filesystem and offers
to remove it. It is able to find:

.. hlist::
   :columns: 2

   + Duplicate files & directories.
   + Nonstripped Binaries
   + Broken symlinks.
   + Empty files.
   + Recursive empty directories.
   + Files with broken user or group id.

**Key Features:**

.. hlist::
   :columns: 3

   + Extremely fast.
   + Flexible and easy commandline options.
   + Choice of several hashes for hash-based duplicate detection
   + Option for exact byte-by-byte comparison (only slightly slower).
   + Numerous output options.
   + Option to store time of last run; next time will only scan new files.
   + Many options for original selection / prioritisation.
   + Can handle very large file sets (millions of files).
   + Colorful progressbar. (ðŸ˜ƒ)

User manual
-----------

Although ``rmlint`` is easy to use, you might want to read these chapters first.
They show you the basic principles and most of the advanced options:

.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 2

   install
   tutorial
   gui
   cautions
   faq

Since version ``2.4.0`` we also feature an optional graphical user interface:

    height="450"
    frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen
    allowfullscreen></iframe>
   </center>

Informative reference
---------------------

These chapters are informative and are not essential for the average
user. People that want to extend ``rmlint`` might want to read this though: 

.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 1
       
   developers
   translators
   benchmarks
   Online-manpage of rmlint(1) <rmlint.1>

The Changelog_ is also updated with new and futures features, fixes and overall
