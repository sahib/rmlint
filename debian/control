Description: Extremely fast tool to remove file duplicates and other filesystem lint
 rmlint finds space waste and other broken things on your filesystem
 and offers to remove it.
 .
 It findsâ€¦
  * Duplicate Files and duplicate directories.
  * Nonstripped binaries (i.e. binaries with debug symbols)
  * Broken symbolic links.
  * Empty files and directories.
  * Files with broken user or/and group ID.
 .
 Differences to other duplicate finders:
  * Extremely fast (no exaggeration, we promise!).
  * Paranoia mode for those who do not trust hashsums.
  * Many output formats.
  * No interactivity.
  * Search for files only newer than a certain mtime.
